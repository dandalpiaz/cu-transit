# MTD Bus

A web application for finding bus times for the [Champaignâ€“Urbana Mass Transit District](https://mtd.org/)

## TODO

- add instructions for creating a virtual enviornment and installing dependencies
- refresh stop pages every 30 seconds, add countdown, show last load time
- use ajax to reload data, instead of meta refresh
- search stops by current location? show maps for stops?
- heroku instructions
- how to add to homescreen (android only?)
